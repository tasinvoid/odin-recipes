<h3>Description</h3>
<p>An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced parsley</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper,</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>3 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<h4>Step 1:</h4>
<p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet
    firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and toss with butter, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
    Keep noodles warm while preparing the chicken.

</p>
<h4>Step 2:</h4>
<p>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add oil, shallots, and
    garlic; saute until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in pasta sauce, chicken broth, and red wine vinegar.</p>
<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<p>Season chicken with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add chicken to the pot. Close and lock the
    lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes
    for pressure to build.

</p>
<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<p>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release
    remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method.
