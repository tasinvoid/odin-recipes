<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This chicken paprikash can be made either in an Instant Pot or on the stovetop. No matter which method you use, it
    will be cooked in less than 30 minutes! Feel free to use a blend of paprika--I used 3 different types: smoked
    paprika, sweet paprika, and regular paprika</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced parsley</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper,</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>3 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<h4>Step 1:</h4>
<p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet
    firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and toss with butter, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
    Keep noodles warm while preparing the chicken.

</p>
<h4>Step 2:</h4>
<p>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Add oil, shallots, and
    garlic; saute until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in pasta sauce, chicken broth, and red wine vinegar.</p>
<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<p>Season chicken with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add chicken to the pot. Close and lock the
    lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 12 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes
    for pressure to build.

</p>
<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<p>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Release
    remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method.
